<section>
    <h2>Objectives of Testing</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Manual Testing</strong> - This will involve detailed validation of the application’s core functionalities, including user registration, login, post creation, user interactions (likes, comments, and connections), and profile management. Manual testing will also cover boundary cases, negative testing, and scenarios that are challenging to automate. Additionally, it will focus on ensuring a smooth user experience and identifying any issues that may not be detected through automation.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>API Testing</strong> - Using Postman, we will test backend services to ensure accurate and efficient data handling. This includes validating CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both users and posts. We will also test the APIs’ security, error handling, and performance under various conditions. The goal is to ensure that all API endpoints respond correctly with the expected status codes and data formats, even under edge cases or high loads.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing</strong> - Automation will be conducted using Selenium WebDriver and Java to increase the efficiency and reliability of regression testing. The focus will be on automating high-priority scenarios such as user registration, login, and post creation. Automation scripts will be designed to run across different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility. The use of page object models and data-driven testing techniques will make the scripts robust and maintainable.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Performance Testing</strong> - Utilizing JMeter, performance testing will be conducted to assess the application's behavior under high traffic and concurrent user loads. We will simulate real-world scenarios to identify potential bottlenecks and ensure that the system maintains acceptable response times and stability. Stress testing will also be performed to determine the maximum capacity of the application and its ability to recover gracefully from failures.</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Testing Strategy</h2>

    <p>To ensure the quality and stability of the social network application, we have developed a comprehensive testing strategy that encompasses manual testing, automation, and API verification:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Manual Testing</strong>: Initially, we will perform thorough checks of core functionalities such as user registration, login, post creation, likes, comments, and profile management. The goal is to identify and document all critical and high-risk bugs in <strong>Jira</strong>. Our team will employ "exploratory testing" techniques to cover edge cases and unpredictable scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>API Testing with Postman</strong>: Once the initial manual testing and bug documentation are completed, we will use <strong>Postman</strong> to validate all key API endpoints. This will include not only basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) but also the system's behavior for various response statuses (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.). We will also test API security by checking for proper handling of unauthorized requests and error management.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing with Selenium WebDriver</strong>: After resolving major issues, we will begin automation using <strong>IntelliJ</strong> and <strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong> to streamline regression testing. The focus will be on automating critical user flows like registration, login, and post creation, ensuring there are no regressions with each update. We will implement the "page object model" design pattern and use data-driven testing techniques to make our scripts robust and easily maintainable across multiple browsers.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Cross-browser Testing</strong>: We will validate the application's performance on major browsers, including <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>, and <strong>Safari</strong>, to ensure a consistent user experience and prevent compatibility issues. These tests will be automated using Selenium Grid to cover various browser environments efficiently.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Performance Testing with JMeter</strong>: We will use <strong>JMeter</strong> to conduct load testing, simulating high user traffic and assessing system behavior under stress. The goal is to identify potential performance bottlenecks and ensure that the application remains stable under peak loads. Stress testing will be performed in different environments to measure the maximum performance capacity and evaluate the system's ability to recover gracefully from failures.</li>
    </ol>

        <div style="height: 3px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Weekly Meetings</strong>: Once a week, we have an in-depth meeting to review achievements, discuss the project status, and identify both new and existing risks. We also plan mitigation strategies if things aren't going as expected.</li>
        <div style="height: 3px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Backup Test Environments</strong>: We maintain backup environments and virtual machines to ensure flexibility if issues arise with the primary setup.</li>
        <div style="height: 3px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Resource Planning</strong>: We allocate tasks and resources ahead of time, ensuring everyone knows their responsibilities. If needed, we can quickly reallocate resources to handle critical situations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As a team, we believe that successful testing relies on good organization, efficient communication, and swift problem-solving. Our approach enables us to work in sync and stay prepared for any challenges that may arise.</p>

    <p>To maintain the reliability of the API, it is essential to handle errors gracefully and ensure meaningful feedback is provided to users. The following outlines the areas of focus for testing exception handling:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Validation Errors:</strong></span><br> Ensure the API returns clear error messages when input data fails validation checks, such as missing or improperly formatted fields.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Resource Not Found:</strong></span><br> Verify that the API handles requests for non-existent resources appropriately, returning a suitable "not found" response.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong></span><br> Check that access to protected endpoints is restricted without valid authentication and returns an appropriate error message.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Forbidden Action:</strong></span><br> Confirm that users are prevented from performing unauthorized actions, and the system responds with an appropriate "forbidden" message.</li>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <li><strong>Internal Server Errors:</strong></span><br> Simulate unexpected system errors to ensure the API handles them gracefully and provides a general error response without exposing sensitive information.</li>
