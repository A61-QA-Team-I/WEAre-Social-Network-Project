    <h1>Automation Testing Documentation for WEAre-Selenium WebDriver</h1>
</header>
<section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>WEAre social network platform</strong>, hosted at
        <a href="http://localhost:8081" target="_blank">http://localhost:8081</a>,
        underwent extensive automation testing to ensure its core functionalities operate as expected
        and meet defined requirements. The automation process was conducted from
        <strong>November 13, 2024, to November 23, 2024</strong>, focusing on validating critical workflows,
        identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring a robust testing foundation for future enhancements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team implemented a <strong>custom Selenium WebDriver framework</strong> that follows the
        <strong>Page Object Model (POM)</strong> design pattern. This approach enabled modularity,
        reusability, and ease of maintenance for automated tests. With the use of <strong>Junit</strong>
        for test execution and reporting, and <strong>Maven</strong> for dependency management,
        we ensured the testing process was efficient and well-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
        The automation covered a wide range of scenarios, including requirements-based tests
        and failure-to-meet-requirements tests. These tests were meticulously selected based on
        equivalence partitioning and platform requirements to simulate real-world use cases and edge cases.
        While the automated tests validate a significant portion of the platform's functionality, several
        failures were observed due to validation issues in the application, highlighting areas that require
        immediate attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the identified challenges, the automation framework demonstrates a high degree of flexibility
        and scalability. Once the current issues are resolved, it will be straightforward to extend the test
        suite for future features and enhancements.

    <h2>Initial Approach and Challenges</h2>
    <h3>Initial Approach:</h3>
    <p>
        The testing process was structured to maximize efficiency and provide clear traceability. We started by:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Designing the test scenarios based on platform requirements and equivalence partitioning techniques.</li>
        <li>Implementing reusable page classes using the Page Object Model (POM) for modularity.</li>
        <li>
            Structuring the tests into two categories:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirements-Based Tests:</strong> Validating expected functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Failure-to-Meet-Requirements Tests:</strong> Highlighting gaps in validation and input handling.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Validation Gaps:</strong> The platform lacked proper validation for passwords, usernames, and duplicate emails, leading to test failures in equivalence partitioning scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge Cases:</strong> Handling of string lengths and unsupported characters in inputs was incomplete, causing tests to fail.</li>
        <li><strong>Localhost Stability:</strong> The localhost environment occasionally exhibited slow responses, which required retries to ensure consistent test results.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario Failures:</strong> Tests related to edge cases (e.g., long usernames, invalid passwords) failed due to platform-level issues.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Technologies and Approach</h2>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The automation process effectively validated the majority of the platform's functionalities through a structured approach combining <strong>requirements-based testing</strong> and <strong>failure-to-meet-requirements testing</strong>. Our custom-built framework, designed with <strong>Page Object Model (POM)</strong> principles, proved to be robust, scalable, and reusable, allowing seamless execution of diverse test scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, during the process, several <strong>critical gaps</strong> were identified in the platform's validation mechanisms, particularly around password rules, duplicate email handling, and input constraints. These issues caused certain equivalence partitioning tests to fail, highlighting the need for immediate attention to improve input validation and error handling.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a team, we made significant strides by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automating 100% of the selected scenarios.</li>
        <li>Covering both <strong>positive and negative</strong> workflows to simulate real-world use cases.</li>
        <li>Identifying critical edge cases that are currently not handled by the platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While the test scenarios and the automation framework are well-structured and comprehensive, our assessment is that the <strong>WEAre social network platform is not yet production-ready</strong>. For the platform to move closer to readiness, the following steps are crucial:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Resolve the identified issues with password validation, duplicate email detection, and input length constraints.</li>
        <li>Revisit and improve error messaging and feedback mechanisms for invalid inputs to ensure a seamless user experience.</li>
        <li>Perform a <strong>retest of all failed scenarios</strong> once fixes are implemented.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        As a team, we firmly believe that the platform has the potential to meet production standards after addressing these challenges. With our automation framework in place, any future updates or fixes can be validated efficiently and with minimal effort. This framework also lays a strong foundation for scaling test coverage as the platform evolves with additional features.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, while the platform currently requires additional development effort, our automation efforts have established a clear roadmap for achieving a stable, production-ready system. The insights gained during this testing phase will serve as a valuable guide for future development and quality assurance.
